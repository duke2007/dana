A django blog.
This blog is perfectly functional. I supose you can setting up
the server on localhost:8000 (after install Django framework, open Terminal - i use a Mac - cd from folder you create to hold Django site and write the command: $ sudo python3 manage.py runserver and hit Enter.).
I make this blog with big help from "Django girls" tutorial.
